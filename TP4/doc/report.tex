\title{Image Analysis - TP4 - K Means}

\section{Initial concept}

The \emph{k-means} split the image in k number of sets based in some parameters. Those parameters are heuritics to split the set, one common way to splits the sets is in a 3d dimensional space, in which the domain of the space is [0,255] and each axle is the color space RGB. 

\section{Initial values influent}

The selection of the initial values may be done by a random selection, since each of those k points will be re-arranged according to pixels assigned to that group, those initial k tend for the same direction independently of the initial values.

\section{Number of regions}

As the \emph{k} represents the number of sets, this determines the distinct number of regions that exists in the picture, so as more \emph{k} are chosen, more detailed the image will be.
